            This is visualization of <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit">JUnit</a> project
            code history from January 2001 to September 2013.
            It was done with <a href="https://github.com/dkandalov/code-history-mining">this IntelliJ plugin</a> and some scripts.
            There is no particular method behind this so if you have an idea,
            please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/dkandalov/code-history-mining/issues/new">suggest it</a>.
            (You can find csv file with events and original visualizations

        <h4>Change size chart</h4>
        Shows amount of changes by day/week. The idea is to see overall trend of the project.
        <p id="change-size-chart"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Amount of committers</h4>
        Shows how many different people committed over month/week/day.
        The idea is to see the amount of people contributing to the project.
        <p id="amount-of-committers-chart"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Amount of files in commit</h4>
        Shows average amount of files in commit by day/week/month.
        Assuming that commit is a finished unit of work, the idea is to see how its size changes over time.
        <p id="amount-of-files-in-commit-chart"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Files changed in the same commit</h4>
        Shows files which were changed in the same commit several times.
        Thickness of edges is proportional to the number of commits.
        The idea is to discover de facto dependencies between files.
        <br/>
        You can click on nodes to see file names in cluster.
        <p id="files-in-the-same-commit"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Committers changing same files</h4>
        Shows commiters connections to files they have both changed within a week.
        That is if file was modified by two persons within a week, a link is added.
        The is idea is to discover how people "communicate" through changing same files.
        <br/>
        This particular graph is not very accurate because of different
        VCS user names for the same person (e.g. "dsaff" and "David Saff").

        <p id="author-to-file-graph"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Amount of commits treemap</h4>
        Shows a break-down of commits by package/folder.
        Size of rectangles corresponds to amount of commits.
        The idea is to see which parts of the project have more attention
        (e.g. ratio between commits to production code and tests).
        <br/>
        (Renamed and moved package are tracked but only current package name is displayed.)
        <p id="commit-treemap"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Commit time punchcard</h4>
        Shows amount of commits at certain time of day (similar to
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-graphs#punchcard">github punchcard</a>).
        <br/>
        Note that you can also group commits by minute (inspired by
        <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2012/03/26/subsecond-offset-heat-maps/">subsecond offset heatmaps</a>).
        <p id="commit-time-punchcard"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Time between commits histogram</h4>
        Shows histogram of time between commits by each committer.
        <br/>
        (If time between commits is less than 1 minute, it's discarded assuming it was a merge from pull request.)
        <p id="time-between-commits-histogram"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Commit messages wordcloud</h4>
        This is a word cloud from commit messages excluding some of prepositions and articles.
        The idea is to see what happened with code by observing human language.
        <br/>
        This particular cloud might not be very representative because of commit messages
        with meta-information (that's why cloud has "threeriversinstitute" in it).
        You can alt-click on words to exclude them.
