            This is visualization of <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit">JUnit</a> code history using
            <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>.
            Produced with <a href="https://github.com/dkandalov/code-history-mining">this IntelliJ plugin</a>.

        <h4>Change size chart</h4>
        Shows amount of changes by day/week. The idea is to see overall trend of project.
        <p id="change-size-chart"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Amount of committers</h4>
        <p id="amount-of-committers-chart"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Files changed in the same commit</h4>
        This graph shows files which were changed in the same commit at least 7 times.
        Thickness of edges is proportional to the number of commits.
        Renamed and moved files are tracked but only current file name is displayed.
        The idea is to discover de facto dependencies between files.
        <p id="files-in-the-same-commit"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Committers changing same files</h4>
        This graph shows committers and files. If file was edited by one committer
        and then edited by another within a week, a link is added. Links that happened at least 7 times
        are added to the graph.
        The is idea is to discover communication patterns and shared code "ownership".
        <br/>
        In this particular case graph is not very accurate because of different
        VCS user names for the same person (e.g. "dsaff" and "David Saff").

        <p id="author-to-file-graph"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Amount of commits treemap</h4>
        Shows a break-down of commits by package.
        Renamed and moved package are tracked but only current package name is displayed.
        The idea is to see which parts of the project have more attention
        (e.g. ration between changes in test and production code).
        <p id="commit-treemap"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Commit time punchcard</h4>
        Shows amount of commits at certain time of day (this is similar to
        <a href="https://github.com/blog/1093-introducing-the-new-github-graphs">GitHub punchcard</a>).
        <br/>
        Note that you can also group commits by minute (inspired by
        <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2012/03/26/subsecond-offset-heat-maps/">subsecond offset heatmaps</a>).
        <p id="commit-time-punchcard"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Time between commits histogram</h4>
        Shows histogram of time between commits by each committer.
        <br/>
        (If time between commits is less than 1 minute, it's discarded assuming it was a merge from pull request.)
        <p id="time-between-commits-histogram"></p>
        <br/><br/>

        <h4>Commit messages wordcloud</h4>
        This is a word cloud from commit messages excluding some of prepositions and articles.
        The idea is to see what happened with code by observing human language.
        <br/>
        This particular cloud might not be very representative because of commit messages
        with meta-information (that's why cloud has "threeriversinstitute" in it).
        You can alt-click on words to exclude them.
        <p id="commit-word-cloud"></p>
        <br/>


        <h4>Changes calendar view</h4>
        Shows amount of changes by day in a calendar layout.
        Each square represents a day. The more commits on the day, the more intense its color.
        <p id="calendar-view"></p>
